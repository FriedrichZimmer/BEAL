# Carla Attack Simulator

## Description
Collection of videos generated in CARLA that simulate the dirty road patch and three points attack. These videos can be used for testing the robustness of autonomous driving computer vision models against those attacks.

The DRP videos were generated with the CARLA-TSR-adversarial-benchmark tool at https://github.com/FriedrichZimmer/CARLA-TSR-adversarial-benchmark.
